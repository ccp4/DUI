# DUI: a Graphical Interface for DIALS

DIALS (https://dials.github.io) is a set of command-line tools for
processing X-ray diffraction data - the Dials User Interface (DUI) is
a GUI to allow the general user to run DIALS tools and inspect the
output without resorting to detailed command-line usage.

Development of DUI is funded by CCP4 and Diamond Light Source
